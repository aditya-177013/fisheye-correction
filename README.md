# Fisheye Image Correction with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to correct fisheye distortion in images using OpenCV. It allows users to load distorted images, apply correction based on camera calibration parameters, and visualize the undistorted results.

## Features

- **Load and Display Distorted Images**: Easily load and view distorted images.
- **Apply Fisheye Distortion Correction**: Use camera matrix and distortion coefficients to correct image distortion.
- **Interactive Sliders**: Adjust distortion coefficients in real-time to see immediate effects.
- **Optimal New Camera Matrix**: Compute and apply an optimal new camera matrix for undistortion.
